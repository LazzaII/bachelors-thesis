## Installation

To run the hybrid genetic algorithm, it is necessary to install the **PlatEMO** library for MATLAB. You can download it from the official MathWorks repository:  
ðŸ”— [PlatEMO on MATLAB Central](https://it.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/105260-platemo)

### Setup Instructions

1. Copy the contents of the [`HGA`](HGA/) folder into the `Algorithms` directory of **PlatEMO**.
2. Open MATLAB and run the following command to launch the PlatEMO GUI:
   ```matlab
   platemo();
   ```
3. To test the algorithm with a benchmark problem:
   - Click on **Open file** in the **Algorithms** section.
   - Select the file [`HYBRIDGA.m`](HGA/HYBRIDGA.m).
   - Choose a **multi-objective problem**, either **real-valued, binary, or permutative**.
